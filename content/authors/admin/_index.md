I am PhD candidate in the Department of Economics and a member of the DIAL research team at Paris Dauphine University, a college of PSL University. My research focuses on environmental health, technology adoption and gender equality in developing countries.

Before starting my PhD, I spent nine years working as a project manager in the NGO sector with a focus on access to energy and clean cooking.
